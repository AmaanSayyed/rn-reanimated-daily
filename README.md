# 🎬 RN Reanimated Daily

A personal learning journey into **React Native Reanimated**.
This repo is my daily playground where I explore animations, gestures, and UI interactions in React Native using [Reanimated 3](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).

---

## 📖 About

-   🏗 Practicing **daily animation experiments** with React Native Reanimated.
-   🎯 Goal: Build a strong foundation in animations for real-world apps.
-   🧪 Every commit = a small step forward (new concept, feature, or experiment).

---

## 🚀 Topics I’ll Explore

-   ✅ Basic animations (opacity, scale, translate, rotate)
-   ✅ Shared values and `useAnimatedStyle`
-   ✅ Gestures with `react-native-gesture-handler`
-   ✅ Layout animations & transitions
-   ✅ Advanced animations (spring, decay, interpolation)
-   ✅ Complex UI effects (cards, modals, loaders, carousels, etc.)

---

## 📂 Structure

Each folder will represent a **daily experiment**, for example:

```
rn-reanimated-daily/
  ├── day01-basic-fade-in/
  ├── day02-scale-bounce/
  ├── day03-gesture-swipe/
  └── ...
```

---

## 🛠 Setup

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmaanSayyed/rn-reanimated-daily.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

## 🌟 Why this repo?

I believe **consistency beats intensity**.
By practicing daily with Reanimated, I’ll sharpen my animation skills and create a library of mini-projects to revisit anytime.

---

## 📅 Progress

✅ Day 1: Basic fade-in animation
⬜ Day 2: TBD

---

## 📌 Notes

-   This is a **learning repo**, not a polished library.
-   Feel free to fork, learn, and experiment along with me!
